React Project Setup Assignment

1. What is NPM?
NPM stands for Node Package Manager. It is a tool used to install, manage, and update JavaScript packages and libraries needed for a project. It helps developers easily install tools like React and Vite.

2. What is package.json?
package.json is a file that contains important information about a project such as the project name, dependencies, version, and commands used to run the project. It helps manage the project structure and tools.

3. What is Vite?
Vite is a modern development tool used to quickly build and run fast web applications like React. It provides a faster development experience compared to older tools.

4. How I Set Up My React Project
Here is a step by step guide: 
1. Installed Node.js
2. Created a React project using Vite
3. Installed project dependencies using npm install
4. Ran the project using npm run dev
5. Uploaded the project to GitHub

















# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
